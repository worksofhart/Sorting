# TO-DO: implement the Merge Sort function below USING RECURSION
# Algorithm
# 1. While your data set contains more than one item, split it in half
# 2. Once you have gotten down to a single element, you have also *sorted* that element 
#    (a single element cannot be "out of order")
# 3. Start merging your single lists of one element together into larger, sorted sets
# 4. Repeat step 3 until the entire data set has been reassembled
